## üìù Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**Description**  
This script defines a function named `factorial` that takes an integer input and calculates its factorial using recursion. The function is then called with a sample value, and the result is displayed.

**Features**

- Demonstrates function definition and usage
- Uses recursion for calculating factorial
- Handles positive integers only
- Clean and informative output

## üìù Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**Description**  
This script prompts the user to input a number and uses Python‚Äôs built-in `math` module to perform the following operations:

- Calculate the square root
- Calculate the natural logarithm (log base e)
- Calculate the sine of the number (in radians)

**Features**

- Utilizes built-in `math` module functions
- Handles real number inputs
- Displays calculated results in a readable format

## ‚úÖ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system (`python --version`)
2. Run the scripts from your terminal:

```bash
# For Task 1
python Task-1.py

# For Task 2
python Task-2.py
